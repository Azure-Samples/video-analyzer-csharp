The 'src' folder contains the following sub-folders:

* **cloud-video-processing** - This folder contains .NET Core console apps that enable you to capture and record live video from an RTSP-capable camera.

* **video-consumption** - This folder contains two samples:
 
    * **token-issuer**: An application for generating [JSON Web Tokens](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519). The output can then be used with the Video Analyzer [player widgets](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-video-analyzer/video-analyzer-docs/player-widget) for playback of video.
    * **video-player**: This folder contains a ReactJS app that will enable you to view videos and create zones (lines or polygons) using the Video Analyzer player widget.

* **video-export** - This folder contains a .NET Core console app that enables you to export a portion of a recorded video as an MP4 file.
